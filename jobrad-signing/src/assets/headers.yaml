    - Idempotency-Key:
        description: |
          The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
          identify a request. It is used by the service to identify subsequent
          retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behavior by sending
          the same response without executing the request a second time.

          Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key
          may return the same response without further check. Therefore, it is
          recommended to use an UUID version 4 (random) or any other random
          string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

          Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay
          within this limits, if they require idempotent behavior.

        type: string
        format: uuid
        required: false
