Headers:
  type: object
    X-RateLimit-Limit:
      type: integer
      description: Request limit per hour.
    X-RateLimit-Remaining:
      type: integer
      description: The number of requests left for the time window.
    X-RateLimit-Reset:
      type: string
      format: date-time
      description: The UTC date/time at which the current rate limit window resets

  Idempotency-Key:
    description: |
      The idempotency key is a free identifier created by the client to
      identify a request. It is used by the service to identify subsequent
      retries of the same request and ensure idempotent behavior by sending
      the same response without executing the request a second time.

      Clients should be careful as any subsequent requests with the same key
      may return the same response without further check. Therefore, it is
      recommended to use an UUID version 4 (random) or any other random
      string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

      Idempotency keys expire after 24 hours. Clients are responsible to stay
      within this limits, if they require idempotent behavior.

    type: string
    format: uuid
    example: '7da7a728-f910-11e6-942a-68f728c1ba70'

  Cache-Control:
    description: |
      The RFC 7234 Cache-Control header field is providing directives to
      control how proxies and clients are allowed to cache responses results
      for performance. Clients and proxies are free to not support caching of
      results, however if they do, they must obey all directives mentioned in
      [RFC-7234 Section 5.2.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234) to the
      word.

      In case of caching, the directive provides the scope of the cache
      entry, i.e. only for the original user (private) or shared between all
      users (public), the lifetime of the cache entry in seconds (max-age),
      and the strategy how to handle a stale cache entry (must-revalidate).
      Please note, that the lifetime and validation directives for shared
      caches are different (s-maxage, proxy-revalidate).

    type: string
    required: false
    example: 'private, must-revalidate, max-age=300'

  Vary:
    description: |
      The RFC 7231 Vary header field in a response defines which parts of
      a request message, aside the target URL and HTTP method, might have
      influenced the response. A client or proxy cache must respect this
      information, to ensure that it delivers the correct cache entry (see
      [RFC-7231 Section
      7.1.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4)).

    type: string
    example: 'accept-encoding, accept-language'
